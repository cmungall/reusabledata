  - 'This curation is for the post two-year embargo window data, excluding EcoCyc and MetaCyc which are current and supported by the NIH; data within that window is available with a subscription.'
  - 'All data access to the downloads is mediated by an individual URL/password/login combination that is obtained by filling out a form and waiting for a response. The curator waited a little over two business days for their response.'
