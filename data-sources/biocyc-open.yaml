license-issues:
  - criteria: 'A.2.2'
    comment: 'Non-standard/custom license.'
  - criteria: 'B.1'
    comment: 'One term of the license is that you must "Notify SRI that you are making BIOCYC DATABASES available in this manner"; this, combined with somewhat bulky access (see comments), I believe rises to a barrier to reuse as a manual step invloving people has been added.'
  - criteria: 'D.1.2'
    comment: 'The license specifically notes that it is being licensed to you and you do not have rights betond that; I believe that this puts second-hand reuse in question: you may remix, but a downstream party from you would have to register and comply directly with BioCyc.'
license-commentary:
  - 'This curation is for the post two-year embargo window data, excluding EcoCyc and MetaCyc which are current and supported by the NIH; data within that window is available with a subscription.'
  - 'All data access to the downloads is mediated by an individual URL/password/login combination that is obtained by filling out a form and waiting for a response. The curator waited a little over two business days for their response. I do not believe this constitutes a violation of C.2 by itself.'
  - 'The core of the license seems to be essentially: "...you may use, modify and redistribute the BIOCYC DATABASES on a royalty-free basis, worldwide, and for any purpose; provided that[...]" changes are identified and BioCyc is credited in a couple of specific ways, including branding.'
  - 'The terms are very interesting. I believe the D.1.2 violation could also be interpreted as a D.1.1 violation.'
