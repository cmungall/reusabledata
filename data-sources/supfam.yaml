license-commentary:
  - 'The relatively high score hinges on the positive or negative evaluation of whether the declaration of "freely available...to everyone" constitutes a wnough of license; I have decided that it does, but it is a close call.'
  - 'Only other notice was in footer: "Â© The SUPERFAMILY authors and Julian Gough 2001-2019."; taking this a an elaboration on above.'
