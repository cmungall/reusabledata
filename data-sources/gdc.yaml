    comment: 'After searching around GDC and cancer.gov, no centralized licensing or terms could be found.'
license-commentary:
  - 'After much searching, no centralized or clear terms could be found.'
  - 'When accessing individual files, there was metadata such as \"Access\": \"open\", so it would seem that any terms, if they did exist, would unlikely be complete.'
  - 'The initial click-through contains some worrying verbiage: \"You are accessing a U.S. Government web site which may contain information that...is intended for Government authorized use only. Unauthorized attempts to...use of this web site may result in disciplinary action, civil, and/or criminal penalties...\"'
  - 'Some data would seem to require additional controls: \"GDC data is stored in a secure FISMA-compliant facility. Access to controlled data requires authorization via dbGaP. See Data Access Processes and Tools for more information.\"'
  - 'While some terms information was found at https://www.cancer.gov/policies/copyright-reuse, it seemed to be about site content rather than data.'
  - 'While licensing information could not be found, access was not problematic.'
