# Curating a Resource

This is a glossary of fields used by the data resource descriptor file
convention of the (Re)usable Data Project.

A [template file](../data-sources/source.template) is provided to
assist with this process, and this documentation mirrors the
description of these fields as they appear on reusabledata.org data
source detail pages.

To make sure structured information is displayed properly, users may
want to view this file in the [original form on GitHub](https://github.com/reusabledata/reusabledata/blob/master/docs/schema.md).

## id
#### Field Description

Unique ID of the resource, biodbcore or NAR preferred. But any unique
internal ID is usable.

This is a short-form identifier (often an initialism) for the resource
created by the curator. By convention, this is typically the same as
the file prefix describing the resource. Dashes are used in lieu of
spaces when needed.

#### Example Values
`civicdb`, `bgee`, `mgi`, `monarch`, `pmkb`, `ncbi-gene`
## description
#### Field Description

A full description of the resource from the resource itself, if
possible.

#### Example Value
'Integrate, align, and re-distribute cross-species gene, genotype,
variant, disease, and phenotype data. Provide a portal for exploration
of phenotype-based similarity. Facilitate identification of animal
models of human disease through phenotypic similarity. Enable
quantitative comparison of cross-species phenotypes. Develop
embeddable widgets for data exploration. Influence genotype and
phenotype reporting standards. Improve ontologies to better curate
genotype-phenotype data.'
## last-curated
#### Field Description

(Optional) The ISO 8601 date of when the license was last reviewed by
a (Re)Usable Data Project curator.

#### Example Value
`2017-12-03`
## source
#### Field Description

A full-length, human-readable name for the resource that
differentiates it from other similar resources.

#### Example Value
`National Center for Biotechnology Information (Gene)`
## source-link
#### Field Description

URL for the resource. (Also described as *Location* in the
reusabledata.org source details view.)

#### Example Value

`http://www.civicdb.org`

## source-type
#### Field Description

(Optional) How the resource relates to the data it contains. Used for gross description; it is naturally hard to categorize many resources.

A `warehouse` value is currently under discussion.

#### Allowed Values

Current allowable entries are: `unknown`, `repository`, `source`, and `integrator`.

  * _repository:_ Describes a resource that, as a major component, allows direct submission of data sets under a specific them, which may not undergo further harmonization.
  * _source:_ Describes a primary source of data or knowledge generated by the source.
  * _integrator:_ Describes a resource that, as a major component, collects and harmonizes content from multiple other resources.
  * _unknown:_ Used when a resource does not qualify for one of the above types or is otherwise hard to categorize.

## status
#### Field Description

Whether or not annotation is complete on this resource. (Also
described as *Curation status* in the reusabledata.org source details
view.)

#### Allowed Values

Current allowable entries are: `complete`, `incomplete`, and `nonpublic`.

  * _complete:_ The draft of the resource curation has been completed and is ready for further processing.
  * _incomplete:_ The draft of the resource curation is incomplete and needs to be finished before further processing. Will not be considered in analysis.
  * _nonpublic:_ The resource has been determined to not be a public resource, therefore cannot be considered under the current rubric. Will not be considered in analysis of public resources.

## data-field
#### Field Description

The area of research for the resource, loosely determined by the
curator. (Also described as *Field* in the reusabledata.org source
details view.)

#### Example Values

`biomedical`, `biology`, `pharmacology`

## data-type
#### Field Description

The type of data the resource contains. (Also described as *Type* in
the reusabledata.org source details view.)

#### Example Values

`x-species`, `cross-species`, `ontology`, `MOD`, `genomic resource`, `pathway`, `sequence`, `human phenotype gene associations`

## data-categories
#### Field Description

(Optional) Free tags to describe the resource and its data. (Also
described as *Categories* in the reusabledata.org source details
view.)

#### Example Values

`cancer`, `precision medicine`, `variants`, `variant disease associations`, `food terminology`, `food ontology`, `food associations`

## data-access
#### Field Description

(Optional) Links and metadata the resource's data in a structured list.

* _location:_ The location of the data access. Do *NOT* worry about getting the perfect and "real" location here; a top-level or informational location is fine.
* _type:_  The type of data access: "download" or "api".
* _label:_ (Optional) How the data access point should be differentiated from others at a resource. E.g. "expression data" or "HPO ontology". Very very optional as this can be a rat's nest.

#### Example Values

```YAML
- type: download
  location: https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/releases
- type: api
  location: https://griffithlab.github.io/civic-api-docs/
- type: api
  location: http://foo.bar/api-v1
  label: old api
```

## license
#### Field Description

The license that is used by the resource. We use
[SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) where we can or: `inconsistent`,
`public domain`, `unlicensed`, `all rights reserved`, or `custom`.

See scripts/source.schema.yaml for the most current full list that we
use (as well as how to update).

#### Example Values

`CC0-1.0`, `CC-BY-4.0`, `custom`, `all rights reserved`

## license-type
#### Field Description

The type of license that is being used. This will be to define
compatible data pools in the future; we only use the grossest terms
now. If it is not known or unclassifiable "unknown" is used.

#### Allowed Values

Current possible values are: `unknown`, `copyleft`, `permissive`,
`copyright`, `restrictive`, `private pool`

## license-link
#### Field Description

(Optional) The link to the resource license. (Also described as
*License location* in the reusabledata.org source details view.)

#### Example Values

`http://www.omim.org/help/agreement`, `http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/inc/legal.inc.php`

## license-hat-used
#### Field Description

(Optional) Setting this flag to true indicates that the licensing was
combinatorially complicated enough (as is the case in some commercial
licenses) that the curator chose to wear a single "hat" during the
process. From the site text:

"While we try to cover as much of the licensing possibilities of a
data resource that we can, in a few cases we may choose a particular
"hat" to wear while evaluating to prevent a combinatorial explosion,
which may also reduce the clarity of our curations for the
community. In these cases, we may take on the role of a (1)
non-commercial (2) academic (3) group that is (4) based in the US and
trying to (5) create an aggregating resource (integrator), noting that
other entities may have different results in the license commentary."

(Also described as *Focused curation* in the reusabledata.org source
details view.)

#### Allowed Values

`true`, `false`

## license-issues
#### Field Description

(Optional) Structured issues with the license.

For every issue discovered with a resource, there should be a
corresponding item in the license-issues field that marks the /exact/
violation, along with any comments. This field can be used by
resources as the first step to improvement, as well as clarify any
surrounding circumstances.

Any issues or thoughts about a resource that do not slot into one of
the criteria violations can go into the license-commentary field. They
may cross reference.

(Also described as *Issues* in the reusabledata.org source details view.)

* _criteria:_ The criteria violated. E.g. "A.1.1", "C.2".
* _comment:_ How the criteria violated.

#### Example Values

```YAML
- criteria: A.1.1
  comment: looked under only rock, not there
- criteria: E.1.1
  comment: clause that effectively uniformly prevents smurfs from accessing the data
```

## license-commentary
#### Field Description

(Optional) Further commentary on the license, possibly including the
process of curation and things like locations of additional licenses.
(Also described as *Commentary* in the reusabledata.org source details
view.)

#### Example Usage

```YAML
- "one thought"
- "another thought"
```

## was-controversial
#### Field Description

(Optional) Marker noting that there was some extended internal
discussion or controversy about the evaluation of the licensing
terms. If this is marked at "true", the controversy, or a link to a
permanent archive of the controversy, must be sufficiently contained
in the "license-commentary" to reconstruct the issues. (Also described
as *Controversial* in the reusabledata.org source details view.)

#### Allowed Values

`true`, `false`

## provisional
#### Field Description

(Optional) In cases where there may not be the bandwidth for multiple
(min. 2) people to review an evaluation, this piece of metadata allows
desired fixes and new evaluations to start moving through the system,
but have a way to keep track of them for additional scrutiny later
on. The assumption is that things are not.

#### Allowed Values

`true`, `false`

## contacts
#### Field Description

(Optional) List of resource contact information, link, email, or
whatever is public.

#### Example Value

```YAML
- https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/contact
- foo@bar.bib
```

## grants
#### Field Description

(Optional) Semi-structured list of supporting grants.

* _label:_ A string representation of the grant.
* _url:_ (Optional) The URL for grant information.

#### Example Value

```yaml
- label: 'Rhea development and curation activities at the SIB are supported by the Swiss Federal Government through the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), and by the SystemsX.ch, The Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology.'
  url: http://foo.bar
- label: 'NIH Grant for Science 123'
```
